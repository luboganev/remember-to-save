This repository contains a primitive project that illustrates a an issue I have faced regarding rememberSavable Compose function.

This project contains:

- A DateTimeUseCase which simply serves the purpose of our data source which lives longer than the UI.
- A simple main-detail Compose navigation between two screens - main screen and details screen,
where the detail screen can only navigate back
- Each screen has a ViewModel
    - MainViewModel is responsible for showing the data from the DateTimeUseCase in the UI
    - DetailViewModel is responsible for updating the data in DateTimeUseCase
- The DetailScreen is not interesting, it contains only a button to modify data and one to navigate back
- The ViewData contains:
    - Key - a UUID generated by the MainViewModel each time a new value comes from DateTimeUseCase
    - The formatted date time value coming from the DateTimeUseCase
- The MainScreen contains the Clock composable which
    - Has input separate parameters the key and the formatted time
    - Shows the formatted time in the UI:
        - Directly
        - Through an extra remember(key) wrapping a state
        - Through an extra rememberSavable(key) wrapping a state

The weird behavior can be reproduced:

- Open detail screen
- Tap update time
- Navigate back
- Notice all texts change besides the one that uses the rememberSavable(key)
